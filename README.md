# GPT Voice Assistant

This is a voice assistant that utilizes the powerful GPT-3.5 language model. When you want to use it, just say 'Hola gpt' and ask it whatever you want.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pablodorrio/gpt-voice-assistant
```

## Set up

### Persistent use

For Linux and macOS users:

```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"' >> ~/.bash_profile

echo 'python3 THE_ROUTE_OF_THE_MAIN_FILE' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

For Windows users:
1. Press Windows + R, type taskschd.msc and press Enter.
2. Select create task.
3. In the "General" section, in the "Name" box, type "gpt-voice-assistant" and select the option "Run only when the user is logged in".
4. In the "Actions" section, press "New" and in the "Program or script" box type "python THE_ROUTE_OF_THE_MAIN_FILE" and press "Accept".
5. In the "Conditions" section uncheck all options and press "Accept".

### Test use

For Linux and macOS users:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

For Windows users:
```powershell
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

## Usage

### Persistent use

The assistant is launched each time you Log in so it will already be available for use.

### Test use

For Linux and macOS users:
```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

For Windows users:
```powershell
python .\src\main.py
```

### Once the programme has started:

Say "Hola gpt" to start the voice recognition and ask the questions you want.

Say "Adi√≥s gpt" when you want to stop using the assistant.

Say "Apagar gpt" to permanently turn off the assistant (it will no longer start even if you say "Hola gpt").

## Limitations

Currently, the assistant is only guaranteed to work correctly in Spanish. However, support for many more languages is coming soon.
